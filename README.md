# porteurbars [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/softprops/porteurbars.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/softprops/porteurbars)

> portable git hosted project templates

Spend less time repeating yourself and enjoy a more comfortable ride. Porteurbars is a command line interface for bootstrapping
your workflow by generating projects from handlebars templates so you can spend more time enjoying what's actually interesting
about starting a new project and less time fussing over what's not.

## goals

* no runtime dependencies
* use existing familiar tools: handlebars, git(hub)
* use environment for configuration
* fast
* focused feature set
* fun
