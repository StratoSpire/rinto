> portable git hosted project templates

Spend less time repeating yourself and enjoy a more comfortable ride. Porteurbars is a command line interface for bootstraping
your workflow by generating projects from handlebars templates so you can spend more time enjoying what's actually interesting
about starting a new project and less time fussing over what's not.

## goals

* no runtime dependencies
* use existing familar tools: handlebars, git(hub)
* use environment for configuration
* fast
* focused featureset
* fun
